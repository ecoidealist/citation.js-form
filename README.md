# Citation.js Archive

This is a branch where you can quickly access different versions of Citation.js. I know, the whole point of version control is not having to do this, but now you don't have to dig through old commits. I guess NPM does that too... It's mainly for personal use anyway, and now I can drop old versions from the main branch.
